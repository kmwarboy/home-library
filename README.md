# Home Library - Personal Project

(In progress - March 2023)
The goal of this project is to showcase various skills across a full-stack React app, while simultaneoously creating something fun for my family to use. The general concept is to be able to scan a book, and populate data based off of API calls via the ISBN. You can then add the book to your collection/library, or choose not to. If the book is already in your library it should provide that information and give you the option to remove it.

This idea was inspired by my 9 year old who is an avid reader, and frequently loses track of which books she has, which books within a series she needs, and other bookworm dilemmas.

The app is built with a React/SCSS frontend, and a backend built using Firebase (for auth and data storage). I'll be blogging about the process here [Medium](https://medium.com/@kmwarboy), and you can check out my personal site and contact me [here](kaitwarboy.dev) with any suggestions or comments.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
